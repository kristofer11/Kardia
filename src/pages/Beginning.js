                    <p> In the midst of a pandemic, many things can change. We saw a need for a new way to educate our children while keeping them social, as well as safe. Homeschooling is a scary word for many families who never envisioned themselves in that position. At Kardia Classical School, our goal is to partner with parents to help them classically educate their kindergarten through eighth-grade children. This is a great opportunity for parents and teachers to work together through this difficult time for the betterment of their childrenâ€™s education.</p>
